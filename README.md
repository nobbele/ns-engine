# ![ns engine logo](https://github.com/nobbele/ns-engine/blob/master/icon.png) NS Engine
An easy to use visual novel engine utilizing the [novelscript](https://github.com/nobbele/novelscript) language

Free and open source engine written in the Rust programming language.

Check the novelscript repository for more information on how to script it.

Currently does not provide any kind of editor, you place the needed files into a resources folder as shown below and run the game.
It also has the ability to compile into a single exe with the resources embeded if that's desirable.

You can contact me on Discord at nobbele#7065 if you have any question about the codebase, the engine or anything like that. 
I am always open for answering them.

Feel free to make issues and pull requests too, I greatly appreciate any contributions!
